# Mini Employee List – Internship Homework

## Extra implementation
The extra feature makes the employee list more flexible and user-friendly. Instead of only searching by name, users can choose to filter by either name or job title. This is especially helpful if someone is looking for a role—like “Software Developer”—rather than a specific person. For example, if you need to find any software developer in the company, just switch the filter to “Title” and type “Software Developer” in the search box. The list updates automatically, making it faster and easier to find the right person based on what you know. It’s a simple upgrade that adds a lot of practical value.

## Story

You’ve just started an internship at **TinyTech**, a fast‑growing startup with twelve staff and zero admin tools. The HR manager keeps juggling spreadsheets and Post‑it notes to remember who does what. Your mission: deliver a **single‑page prototype** that anyone in the office can open in a browser to look up colleagues quickly. Nail this and you’ll earn serious bragging rights (and maybe an extended contract!).

## 1. What to Build

A single‑page site that:

1. Shows a **list of employees** (name + job title).
2. Lets the user click an employee to see more info (email and start date) – an `alert()`, modal, or expanding row is fine.
3. Has a **search box** to quickly find employees by name.

That’s it – no backend, no fancy build tools required.

### Sample data

You can hard‑code an array in your JavaScript **or** load it from `employees.json` – whichever feels easier. Aim for **10** sample employees, e.g.:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Lin Chang",
  title: "Marketing Assistant",
  email: "lin.chang@example.com",
  startDate: "2024-02-01"
}
```

## 2. Rules & Hints

* Use **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks needed).
* Keep your files small and well‑named (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`).
* Make sure the page still works on mobile (flexbox or grid is enough).
* Write clean, readable code – comments welcome.

---

## 3. Creative Feature (Required)

Add **one additional feature of your own design** that improves the Employee List or delights the user. This could be a functional enhancement, a UX touch, a visual flourish, an insight dashboard—anything you believe adds real value.

*Briefly describe your idea* at the top of `app.js` or in a short paragraph in the README so we understand your thinking.

We leave this open‑ended on purpose to see how you think.

## 4. How to Submit

1. **Fork** this repo (or create a new public one).
2. Put your code inside – try to commit in logical steps.
3. Enable GitHub Pages (or use Netlify/Vercel) so we can see a live demo.
